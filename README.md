# thinking-in-c

These are just some algorithms I'm making as I go in an overall course of C programming language in Udemy. 
You may notice that the code does some things like dynamic memory allocation and passing arguments to complicate matters a little. 
This is important to me as I need greater understanding of these algorithms for development and I find that higher level languages don't 
quite convey how important this is.
